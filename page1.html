                                <p class="mbr-fonts-style panel-text display-7">Medicine is a vast field, and especially so in India. Medical careers are available across a multitude of educational and skill levels, but also in diverse fields such as homeopathy or allopathy.
<br>
<br>
<br>Medicine falls into two categories:
<br>i) traditional, also known as alternative, homoeopathic, or holistic;
<br>ii) modern, also known as Western, or allopathic.
<br>
<br>Sometimes there is overlap between the two, and given that there has been resurgence in popularity of traditional medicine over the last few years, more overlap is likely to come as there is an increasing push to incorporate and combine the two fields. At present, though, when choosing a career in medicine to work toward, you should still choose to focus on either one or the other, so as to know which educational track to follow. Below is a list of healthcare career options in India, along with a brief description of each and its minimum required educational training/background.</p>

<br>
<br>A single lawyer can’t do everything alone.
<br>
<br>So chief financial officers, law firm administrators, litigation support professionals, legal assistant, and so many other positions together tell us that Law career is just not about being that lawyer who directly appears in the court to win legal cases. It’s beyond that. Some people formed businesses, some work as an assitant, and some even teach law.
<br>
<br>There are so many things about the law career in the later sections of this guide which are going to give you a lucid explanation of what law career is all about.<br>Prestige: Since ancient times, such a career has been always linked with the prestige because society pays attention to the impressive appearance, high salary, and legal power.
<br>Diversity: In a process of setting up a legal system, the occurrence of diversities is a sure thing. So there exist a variety of legal career options for you ahead. From consultants, secretaries, paralegals, to mediators, judges, and lawyers. More and more career paths are evolving in Law because of the rapid changes.
<br>Opportunities and Growth: For the last few years, meteoric changes have been taking place in the economy, social life, and political institutions. Such changes have proved to expand the revenue and profit of legal professionals. And you know what? It’s just the beginning.
<br>No More Boredom: You will be the another Sherlock Holmes. Papers, sketches, shreds of evidence, so many things will hit you up. And once you start finding patterns for the guilty ones, boredom will never touch you again.
<br>Secure Job: If you are working in an institution or for some sort of corporate, you won’t have a chance to lose the job.
<br>Flexibility: Well, Lawyers are self-governing and they have the chance to make their own schedule, set their own price, and select their own clients. The Lawyer can also stay away from the office for a day in the name of research and personal matters.
<br>Fun: The reason to have fun while working in this job is because of the perks we get. That means, some lawyers travel around the world in order to participate in depositions, trials, business deals, and arbitrations.
<br>Power To Make A Difference: When we were just kids, we have always wanted to possess some sort of supernatural powers because, at that time, we used to compare ourselves to a movie’s superhero who had amazing supernatural powers to change the world. So being a lawyer, you can be that superhero.
<br>Awareness of Rights And Duties: Although we have been taught in schools and colleges about the rights and the duties. However, who pays attention in the class? Right? So once you start your career in Law, you will automatically develop an understanding with the current rights and responsibilities. Next time, no one would be able to bother you legally.<br></p>

Your career options are therefore varied. Try to decide on the area you want to work in and aim to get relevant work experience.
<br>
<br>You can gain work experience at university through extracurricular activities, such as club membership or taking a role on a society that will develop your team-building, business or finance skills. You could also try to get a part-time job in an area related to your chosen career. Something that provides commercial skills or gives you knowledge in business functions and how organisations operate will be helpful.<br><br>Industries as diverse as chemicals, utilities, fashion, health, grocery and construction all require functional managers with a clear understanding of systems, efficiency and operational issues. Opportunities exist in management and analysis roles with employers in the private, public and voluntary sectors.
<br>
<br>Graduate training schemes offered by large employers frequently focus on commercial roles. Many give experience in several departments but others encourage specialisation from the outset.<br><br></p>
